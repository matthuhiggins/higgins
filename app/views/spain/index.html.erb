    <h3>Barcelona - Aug 16</h3>
    <p>
      We arrived in the morning and Brigitte was very sleepy.
      Our amazing trip started with a long nap - the first of many siestas.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Brigitte finally woke up, we walked around the El Gotic neighborhood.
      It includes such sites as the Christopher Colòn monument and Las Romblas, a busy street full of street performers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ate dinner at Pla, then enjoyed too many <%= link_to 'Estrallas', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrella_Damm' %>, and finally Brigitte pretended she was good at the guitar.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'barcelona/1' %>
        
    <h3>Barcelona - Aug 17</h3>
    <p>
      The beach in Barcelona is incredibly crowded, but Matt didn't complain about the topless females.
      Due to her pale Seattle skin, Brigitte was very easy to spot in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a strenous morning of tanning, we needed a siesta.
      We had a siesta every day for the rest of the trip so I'll stop mentioning that part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was action packed.
      It started with a visit to <%= link_to 'Park Güell', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_G%C3%BCell' %>, designed by Gaudi.
      (Everything in Barcelona seems to be designed by Gaudi).
      There was also a street festival in the evening called Fiesta de Gracia, with lots of decorations.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'barcelona/2' %>
    
    <h3>Barcelona - Aug 18</h3>
    <p>
      After feeling bloated from our daily breakfasts of pastries and cafe
      con leche we decided to hit up an American-style restaurant/bar called
      Milk. Egg benedicts brought us the comfort of home. We then devoted
      the rest of our day to tourism.
    </p>
    <p>
      First to La Sagrada Familia (also a
      Gaudi design) which is a giant cathedral that commenced construction
      in 1882 and is set to finish in 2026 (the centennial of Gaudi's
      death). We hope to return to Spain again to see the finished product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came Casa Batllo, which was built by Gaudi for a textile
      industrialist in the early 20th century. We were pleased with the
      underwater theme and light wells. Then we decided to be uber tourists
      and hopped on a sightseeing bus which led us to Montjuic, home of the
      1992 olympics and the communication tower which Matt promptly
      summited. We attempted to forgo our siesta that day and push onwards
      with the tour bus, but we eventually surrendered to the afternoon
      heat.

  <div id="altea">
    <h3>Altea - Aug 19</h3>
    <p>
      We said adios to Barcelona and the heart of Catalonia by hopping in a
      rental car and driving south along the Costa Blanca to Altea. Brigitte
      was driving and was pleased with the fast speeds and prompt left-sided
      passes on the freeways, but freaked out when driving through the
      multi-laned roundabouts of the cities. Our poor little rental car
      could barely make it up the hills. We vetoed the larger/industrial
      city of Valencia for a smaller beach town of Altea, but still stopped
      to see the famed Ciudad de las artes y las ciencias that Matt had been
      talking about for weeks. The external park features did not
      disappoint. We arrived in Altea in the evening and stayed at the first
      of many "hostals"--AKA cheaper hotels all with private
      rooms/baths/balconies. This one even came with a bidet! We booked all
      of these through booking.com, which comes highly recommended for cheap
      foreign travel.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'altea/1' %>
    
    <h3>Altea - Aug 20</h3>
    <p>
      The next couple days in Altea were full of relaxation. We worked on
      our tans on the pebble beaches and ate great meals along a hopping
      waterfront stretch. One of our highlights was renting bikes and riding
      past the town of Albir to hike through the Sierra Helada national park
      (named as such because it looks like a giant iceberg on a moonlit
      night) which offered amazing views of the coastline and had a
      lighthouse at the top. Wished we had spent a couple more days in this
      fantastic town.

  <div id="granada">
    <h3>Granada - Aug 22</h3>
    <p>
      We arrived in Granada in the middle of the siesta and Brigitte was
      nervous we got the directions wrong. It was a sweltering ghost town.
      After waiting out the heat, we ventured to the nearby Albacin
      neighborhood and walked along the river and up to the Mirador San
      Nicolas which had a fantastic view of the ancient Alhambra fortress.
      Found a restaurant with equally amazing views and sipped on our
      sangria as the sun set. Granada is one of the only cities left in
      Spain that will give you free tapas with a drink purchase so we made
      sure to take advantage of that as we meandered our way back to the
      hotel and successfully avoided gypsies known to frequent that area.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'granada/1' %>
    
    <h3>Granada - Aug 23</h3>
    <p>
      Woke up at an alarmingly early Spanish hour (7:30AM) for our tour of
      the Alhambra. This was by far our favorite thing in Granada. Fantastic
      grounds, buildings, and views. Plus we got out of there before the
      heat hit! We got some more free tapas that evening, including the
      worst tapas of all time--fried breadcrumbs called Migas. Madrid was
      playing Barcelona that night so we wandered the streets trying to find
      a "scene" to watch the game at.
    </p>

  <div id="nerja">
    <h3>Nerja - Aug 24</h3>
    <p>
      The primary purpose of going to Nerja was to relax, and that's exactly what we did.
      Matt was also super pumped about the Balcon De Europa!
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way from Granada to Nerja, we saw goats and checked out the Arab Castle.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'nerja/1' %>

    <h3>Nerja - Aug 25 - 27</h3>
    <p>
      There are not many historical tourist attractions in Nerja, but they've got a magical train!
      Despite the fact that the conductor gets to drive a train all day, he didn't seem happy about his job.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we primarily focused on tanning and eating, we checked out the Nerja Caves.
      The cave is HUGE and I'm not even exaggerating.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'nerja/2' %>

  <div id="ronda">
    <h3>Ronda - Aug 28</h3>
    <p>
      If you like cliffs, Ronda is your spot.
      The town is built on a cliff, and there's a very large bridge named <%= link_to 'Puente Nevo', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puente_Nuevo' %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We learned that the qualify of tapas vary greatly between restaurants, even though they all have similar prices.
      Brigitte found a great place called Traga Tapas.
    </p>
    <%= render 'image_array', folder: 'ronda/1' %>
    
    <h3>Ronda - Aug 29</h3>
    <p>
      It was one of those days with a lot of walking, and by now we were used to our shirts being soaked in sweat by the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We missed the bullfighting by a week, but we still visited the arena and brought our own fake bull.
      Matt was all pumped about a painter and bought one of his originals.
      The artist called Matt "boy" and taught him a few things about life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, we checked out the views from the cliff as often as possible, and ended the night at a tapas place called De Locos Tapas.
      It was about $30 for a 6 tapas and a bottle of wine.
      Good thing those Spainiards are in a depression.
    </p>

  <div id="sevilla">
    <h3>Sevilla - Aug 30 - 31</h3>
    <p>
      Only a few days remained in the trip, which was very sad because we were growing accustomed to travelling and not working.
      Sevilla has some well known architecture, including a big old cathedral that they cleverly named Sevilla Catedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bought tickets for the Arab bathhouse, which is a dark place where you sit in hot water, cold water, lukewarm water, salt water and bubbling water.
      After our skin looked like raisins, we had dinner at Vineria el Telmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning after our one night in Sevilla, we visited Sevilla Plaza de Espana before departing to Cordoba.
